## Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
This project aims to predict factors that affect students' grades by employing machine learning classifiers. The dataset used for this project is in CSV format and includes information about students' nationalities, grade levels, and various determining factors such as the number of hands raised, attendances, and hours studied.

### Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- Nationality
- Grade Level
- Number of Hands Raised
- Number of Attendances
- Number of Hours Studied

### Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning classifiers and models have been implemented to achieve accurate predictions. Some of the classifiers used include:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Visualizations:** Create visual aids such as graphs and confusion matrices to illustrate the results and compare the performance of different models.

### How to Use
1 **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebook `Student_Performance_Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to execute the code step by step.

3. **Explore Results:**
   View the visualizations and results in the notebook to understand the impact of different factors on student grades.

### Results
The project provides insights into the factors influencing student performance and compares the performance of different machine learning models. The visual aids, such as graphs and confusion matrices, make it easy to interpret and communicate the results.

Feel free to contribute, raise issues, or suggest improvements to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the predictions.
